Dragon Quest I Remake

By GethN7


Note: Anything else was created by me alone if not mentioned as credited to someone else. Anything I did (original work by me only) may be used by anyone else for commercial or noncommerical purposes, as this game is being released for free and is completely unencrypted  because I believe in open sourcing my work, all I ask is proper credit (letting me know would be nice). Any resources not for free should be credited to their original authors and permission asked for their reuse whenever possible.

All licensed assests are being used under parody/fanfiction purposes, which is why this project will never be marketed for sale. Anyone who does so does not have my support, and I will comply with any legal request to remove this project from circulation should I recieve due legal notice, as I have no intention of costing Square Enix or any other party revenue.

This does not have the RMVX Ace RTP, you need to download it here for this to work:

== Controls ==

At the start, after the intro (speed this up by holding down Enter), hit the Z button to change scene. 

Z and X work like A and B on the regular NES. 

The Directional Arrows are the D-Pad. 

Press F5 for a borderless fullscreen mode, Alt+Enter for a bordered version (has black bars surrounding the game action). 

Pressing F6 in either windowed or fullscreen mode will adjust the aspect ratio, do this until you find the best compromise between image size and appearance.

Hold down the Shift button to dash around for faster walking if autodash has been disabled in the ingame system menu.

The Q and W keys function like the L and R buttons did on SNES games and can be used on certain menus as a toggle or shift feature.

Use the SHIFT key in battles to view info on enemies.


== Tips ==

* Click on EVERYTHING! You never know what you'll find......

* Scour the initial castle, get the Thieves Key (costs 5 Small Medals) and all possible treasure. It will result in providing a lot of bonus money and great initial equipment.

* The game has enemies around the basic region of the main landmass of Tantegel to this point. Level grinding to at least Level 4 is recommended to defeat the first boss, and one should only attempt this after getting all the best equipment for each character that can be found or bought.

* Mara (the mage) is the weakest character defensively, she will be in the greatest danger of damage/death, so keep her HP high at all times.

== Features ==

* In battle, you have a "TP Meter". Once it hits 100%, you basically get several stat boosts due to the adrenaline flowing. 

It will only last at least until the battle ends, though, or unless you die. Using any move that uses TP points will lower this below %100 and remove the boost until it recharges, so bear that in mind.

* Speak with the castle chancellor (the guy between the king and queen where you start) if you want to change the difficulty of the game.

* You can change most of the other game options via the "System" submenu in the player menu.

* Added a "Biography" menu option, so you can learn a little more about your playable characters.

* Speak to Brent the castle librarian to recieve a Key Item that will serve as the ingame encyclopedia, usable from the item menu. It's still WIP, but does have the bestiary worked in at present.

== Story Differences from the original Dragon Quest ==

The game borrows merely the background lore of the first game, coupled with expanded lore found in Dragon Quest III, and from that springboard much has been expanded or written from whole cloth. While the overall plot attempts to maintain consistency with the original Dragon Quest, there are major differences.


* You start with three party members (later, 4)

* There are the Thieves, Magic, and Final Keys, all of which will be needed to finish the game, as opposed to disposable magic keys the player had to keep replenishing. All of the original Hero's equipment will be roughly consistent with Dragon Quest III, with a few allowances for the added armor pieces from Dragon Quest II. The magic system is largely based on Dragon Quest III, with some touches from other games in the series. 

* There will be a multiclass system. One character can unlock their own variety on this fairly early on, while the others gain this as an unlockable much later.

* Many story additions may deviate partially or entirely from the original plot of DQ1, though the key plot points will be honored as much as possible.

* There will be two endings to this game: a normal ending (follows the stock canon from DQ1) and a "True" ending, which will be canon should I ever write a sequel.

* The encounters faced in this game feature most of the monsters from DQ1, and many other from other games in the series. Most of the bosses are either original derivatives of bosses from DQ1 or other DQ games, and if the True Ending route is unlocked, I plan to include a "True Final Boss".


== Gameplay Differences from stock Dragon Quest ==

There are numerous differences, but these are ones that are particularly notable:

1. There are no "attack group" spells. They either hit all, one, or random foes. This is due to game engine and scripting limitations.

2. Game balance has been somewhat altered to compensate for VX Ace's native game engine quirks while still trying to use Dragon Quest formulas.

3. Saving is done via the player menu, not via the king or a priest. I may script the game to work in the classic style later.

4. DO NOT expect many DQ1 specifics, like dark caves that require the Radiant spell or torches. I decided to excise this aspect because, while technically feasible, was incongruous with the rest of the series (particularly DQ3, the prequel) and I deemed it superfluous, since I have drastically redrawn the game world and the only things I have kept completely constant from the original game are the rough location of the original towns.


=== Credits for Resources used ===

Aside from stock RMVX Ace Resources, I used resources from the following:

They are only provided here in the archive for bugtesting and development reasons only in any WIP build, and any official 

release will fall under the same guidelines.

I believe in open sourcing my work because I'd like to make it easier for the community to bugtest my WIP code and offer suggestions and patches for game issues, but these items exist under specific conditions and should not be reproduced elsewhere unless you have your own legal copy for reuse in your own project.
